# scheduled-ship-gate.sh - Decide whether a SCHEDULED ios-ship run should ship.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# .github/workflows/ios-ship.yml gained a `schedule:` trigger because a PR
# merged by github-actions[bot] lands on main under GitHub's recursion guard
# and dispatches no workflow run at all -- so `push:` alone could not be
# trusted to notice that iOS code had landed. Measured on this repo: sha
# c38b6787 (PR #1835, bot-merged, touches clients/ios) produced ZERO runs,
# while sha ceaca097 (PR #1836, human-merged) produced five.
#
# But a cron carries no `paths:` filter, and ship-testflight.sh's own gate only
# tests "is HEAD the sha I last shipped" plus a time interval. Without this
# script, a backend-only commit sitting past the rate-limit window would ship a
# TestFlight build for changes no tester can see. The owner does not want
# TestFlight spammed, so the scheduled path ships only when the app's own
# source tree actually changed since its last successful ship.
#
# Usage:
#   scheduled-ship-gate.sh --path-prefix <dir/> [options] <app_key> [app_key...]
#
# Options:
#   --path-prefix P   Repo-relative path prefix that counts as app source
#                     (required; e.g. clients/ios/ or ios/)
#   --event NAME      GitHub event name (default: $GITHUB_EVENT_NAME).
#                     Anything other than "schedule" votes ship=1 for every
#                     app: a push already passed the workflow's paths filter,
#                     and a manual dispatch is an explicit instruction.
#   --repo-root PATH  Repo to inspect (default: cwd)
#   --state-dir PATH  Where ship-testflight.sh records successful ships
#                     (default: $IOS_FLEET_STATE_DIR, else ~/.cache/ios-fleet)
#
# Output:
#   Human-readable reasoning on stdout, plus, when $GITHUB_OUTPUT is set:
#     should_ship=0|1        1 if ANY listed app should ship
#     ship_<app_key>=0|1     per app, with '-' in the key replaced by '_'
#
# Exit code is always 0 on a decision. Deciding "skip" is a normal outcome and
# must never turn a scheduled tick red.
#
# ASCII-only (Apple bash 3.2 safe), matches ship-testflight.sh conventions.
