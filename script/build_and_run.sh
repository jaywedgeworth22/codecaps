  run            (default) build, install to ~/Applications, relaunch it, then
                 delete the dist staging bundle and Trash every other copy
  --install      the same without relaunching
  --dev          build with the .dev bundle identifier into dist/ and launch it
                 beside the installed app, leaving the installed copy alone
  --dev-stop     quit only this checkout's dev process and delete dist/
  --package      build a universal Release, zip it into dist/ with its SHA-256,
                 and remove the staged .app afterwards
  --release      --package, then notarize and staple the app, rebuild the zip
                 from the stapled bundle, and build, sign, notarize and staple
                 dist/CodeCaps.dmg.  Both artifacts get a .sha256 beside them.
                 Notarization uses the keychain profile named by
                 $AGENTBAR_NOTARY_PROFILE, default "agentbar-notary"
  --build-only   stage dist/CodeCaps.app and stop
  --debug        stage and run under lldb
  --logs         stage, launch, and stream the process log
  --telemetry    stage, launch, and stream this bundle identifier's log
  --verify       stage, launch, and confirm the process is running

  There is exactly one installed copy, at ~/Applications/CodeCaps.app.  Every
  mode that installs also prunes: any other bundle whose CFBundleIdentifier is
  com.jays.agent-bar.mac, under /Applications, ~/Applications, ~/Desktop,
  ~/Downloads, iCloud Downloads or this checkout's dist/, is moved to the Trash
  and printed.  Bundles with another identifier, and bundles inside another
  checkout, are never touched.  Set CODECAPS_PRUNE_DRY_RUN=1 (or
  AGENTBAR_PRUNE_DRY_RUN=1) to print what the prune would Trash without moving
  anything.

  Signing: $CODECAPS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY or $AGENTBAR_CODESIGN_IDENTITY when set,
  otherwise the first "Developer ID Application:" identity in the codesigning
  keychain, otherwise ad-hoc with a warning.  A stable identity is what lets
  the saved Read Token and Ingest Token survive a rebuild — ad-hoc gives every
  build a different code identity, so the Keychain stops trusting the new one.
  --package also signs with the hardened runtime and a secure timestamp and
  prints the notarytool command; --release is the mode that actually notarizes.

  Versions: CFBundleShortVersionString is the VERSION file at the repo root, so
  cutting a release is one edit.  CFBundleVersion is `git rev-list --count
  HEAD`, which only ever goes up.
